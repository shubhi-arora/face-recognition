# Recognito
## Description
The **Recognito** web application acts as an **emotion detector**, 
allowing people to identify their emotions by looking at their faces.
               By keeping suspects on this project's radar, the web app will serve 
               as a **truth-finder** and **distinguisher between an object and a face** for the cops. 
               <br>
                Through its monitoring, this project
                will be able to see every emotion the suspect exhibits. Every 
                emotion will be tracked. After 24 hours, the **most noted emotion** 
                will be displayed after this app has been keeping a watchful eye 
                on culprits. <br>
                As an example-if, the most observed emotion is 
                **happiness**, which means the culprit is not hiding anything and 
                is confident that he is not wrong. When most observed emotion 
                turns into **fear**, it likely means he has a secret and is not 
                telling anyone. There is no doubt that these predictions are 
                accurate because a person who is guilty will definitely become 
                nervous, and this nervousness,fear will definitely be evident on 
                his face. 
                <br>It is almost impossible for a detective to constantly watch a 
                criminal and his emotions, but this web app can do as much as it 
                can. In addition, it eliminates the need to hire additional employees
                 for observation. 
## Features
1. It acts as a **distinguisher** between various objects and faces
2. Whenever **object other than a face** is detected in line of sight of a camera, camera screen **automatically gets freezed** and unblocks only after face comes again in line of sight of camera.
3. Whenever there is a face it **detects emotions** and displays it.
4. Most observed emotion is displayed.
5. Other than the emotion of a person, **race** is also displayed in result section.
